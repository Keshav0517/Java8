1].Default Methods in Interface

-Until Java 1.7 only public abstract methods are allowed inside Interface
But Since java 1.8 Interface have complete methods and static

-To define methods as default we need to use default keyword

-default methods are not with same signature in multiple interface

2].Benifits of default methods
-To adopt default behaviour
-Does not affect other functionality

-default method can be override in their implementation class(when ambiguity arises)
